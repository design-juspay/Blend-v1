# Product Context

## Purpose
The Blend-v1 component library exists to provide a consistent, scalable, and maintainable set of UI building blocks for product teams. It aims to accelerate development, ensure design consistency, and improve code quality across projects.

## Problems Solved
- Reduces duplication of UI logic and styles across projects.
- Ensures visual and behavioral consistency in user interfaces.
- Simplifies onboarding for new developers and designers.
- Centralizes design tokens and accessibility best practices.

## Intended Workflow
- Developers import and use components directly from the library.
- Designers reference the same tokens and patterns for handoff.
- Updates to tokens or patterns propagate across all components.
- Components are easy to extend, customize, and test.

## User Experience Goals
- Consistent look and feel across all products.
- High accessibility and usability standards.
- Fast, predictable, and delightful interactions.
- Easy integration and minimal setup for consumers.
