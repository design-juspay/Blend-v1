# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Establishing and enforcing a modular, scalable component architecture for the Blend-v1 component library.
- Refactoring existing components to follow the established patterns.
- Building a demo system to showcase component variants and usage.

## Current Work Focus

### UI Improvements and Features
1. **Tags Component Refinement:**
   - Completely removed deprecated icon-based props in favor of a pure slot-based API
   - Fixed height inconsistencies and improved typography
   - Added comprehensive token system for styling 
   - Implemented new slot-based API for enhanced flexibility

2. **Demo System Improvements:**
   - Restructured the demo system to be more modular and maintainable
   - Created dedicated component demo files in separate directories
   - Moved Button demos to `src/demos/Button/ButtonDemo.tsx`
   - Moved Tag demos to `src/demos/Tags/TagsDemo.tsx`
   - Simplified `App.tsx` by importing modularized demo components
   - Enhanced component showcasing with better organization and aesthetics

3. **Code Quality Improvements:**
   - Applied consistent styling patterns across components
   - Implemented cleaner utility functions
   - Removed unnecessary comments while maintaining essential documentation
   - Ensured proper TypeScript typing throughout the codebase

## Recent Changes
- Enhanced the Tags component with improved styling and functionality:
  - Fixed height inconsistencies between different variants by implementing consistent border handling
  - Added size-specific border radius values for better visual design
  - Improved SplitTag component to support different variants in left and right sections
  - Integrated InterDisplay font family throughout the component library
  - Implemented box-sizing fixes to ensure consistent dimensions
  - Enhanced token structure with more granular control over styling
  - Completely replaced icon-based props with a slot-based API for leading and trailing content, making the component more flexible and future-proof
- Refactored the Tags component to follow the modular component structure:
  - Created proper TypeScript types with enums for variants, statuses, sizes, and styles
  - Implemented token-based styling using foundationToken.ts as the source of truth
  - Separated styled components, utils, and tokens into their own files
  - Developed both Tag and SplitTag components with consistent APIs
  - Added the components to the demo system with a simple navigation bar
- Enhanced the demo system with a more organized and beautiful UI:
  - Implemented a vertical navigation sidebar for better component organization
  - Created a structured showcase format with labeled component examples
  - Added descriptive section headers and component descriptions
  - Improved visual styling with cards, proper spacing, and consistent typography
  - Demonstrated slot-based API usage with custom content examples
- Documented best practices for code quality and token management.

## Next Steps

1. **Extend Component Library:**
   - Add more base components (Input, Dropdown, etc.)
   - Ensure all components follow the modular architecture pattern

2. **Documentation:**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation for each component
   - Add usage examples and best practices

3. **Testing:**
   - Set up testing infrastructure
   - Add unit tests for components and utilities

## Active Decisions

1. **Slot-Based API for Components:**
   - Moving away from specific props like `icon` to more flexible slot-based patterns
   - Enhances component extensibility and future-proofs the component API

2. **Modular Demo Structure:**
   - Each component should have its own demo file in dedicated demo directories
   - Improves maintainability and reduces complexity in the main application file

3. **Component Directory Structure:**
   - Maintaining strict adherence to the component directory pattern
   - Each component must have its own directory with standardized files

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- All new components must follow the modular directory and file structure.
- Foundation tokens are the single source of truth for design primitives.
- Consider adding specific hover/focus/active states to components for better interactivity.
- Need to decide on a strategy for component variants vs. subcomponents (e.g., SplitTag).
- All components should use box-sizing: border-box to ensure consistent dimensions.
