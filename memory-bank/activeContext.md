# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Establishing and enforcing a modular, scalable component architecture for the Blend-v1 component library.
- Refactoring existing components to follow the established patterns.
- Building a demo system to showcase component variants and usage.

## Recent Changes
- Enhanced the Tags component with improved styling and functionality:
  - Fixed height inconsistencies between different variants by implementing consistent border handling
  - Added size-specific border radius values for better visual design
  - Improved SplitTag component to support different variants in left and right sections
  - Integrated InterDisplay font family throughout the component library
  - Implemented box-sizing fixes to ensure consistent dimensions
  - Enhanced token structure with more granular control over styling
- Refactored the Tags component to follow the modular component structure:
  - Created proper TypeScript types with enums for variants, statuses, sizes, and styles
  - Implemented token-based styling using foundationToken.ts as the source of truth
  - Separated styled components, utils, and tokens into their own files
  - Developed both Tag and SplitTag components with consistent APIs
  - Added the components to the demo system with a simple navigation bar
- Documented best practices for code quality and token management.

## Next Steps
- Continue refactoring or building new components using the documented structure and rules.
- Consider implementing a more robust slot-based API for icons and custom content.
- Add keyboard navigation and accessibility improvements to all components.
- Expand the demo system with more examples and better organization.
- Apply the border handling and box-sizing patterns to other components for consistency.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- All new components must follow the modular directory and file structure.
- Foundation tokens are the single source of truth for design primitives.
- Consider adding specific hover/focus/active states to components for better interactivity.
- Need to decide on a strategy for component variants vs. subcomponents (e.g., SplitTag).
- All components should use box-sizing: border-box to ensure consistent dimensions.
