# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Establishing a robust primitive component system as the foundation for the Blend-v1 component library
- Building higher-level components on top of primitive components
- Implementing a comprehensive token system for consistent styling

## Current Work Focus

### Primitive Components
1. **Block Component (`@Block.tsx`):**
   - Serves as the fundamental layout primitive
   - Supports most layout styling properties
   - Can render as various semantic HTML elements (div, span, section, etc.)
   - Provides comprehensive layout control with flexbox support
   - Handles state-based styling (hover, focus, active, etc.)

2. **PrimitiveText Component (`@PrimitiveText.tsx`):**
   - Base text primitive for typography
   - Supports various semantic text elements (p, h1-h5, span, etc.)
   - Handles basic text styling properties
   - Serves as the foundation for the higher-level Text component

3. **PrimitiveButton Component (`@PrimitiveButton.tsx`):**
   - Base button primitive
   - Handles fundamental button styling and behavior
   - Provides comprehensive layout and visual control
   - Serves as the foundation for higher-level button variants

### Token System
- Moved foundation tokens to dedicated `@tokens` directory
- Organized tokens by category:
  - `color.tokens.ts`: Color palette and semantic colors
  - `font.tokens.ts`: Typography tokens
  - `spacing.tokens.ts`: Layout and spacing values
  - `border.tokens.ts`: Border styles and radius
  - `shadow.tokens.ts`: Elevation and shadow styles
  - `opacity.tokens.ts`: Transparency values
  - `unit.tokens.ts`: Measurement units and scales

## Recent Changes

## Recent Implementation Patterns

### ThemeProvider Integration
We have successfully implemented the ThemeProvider pattern in the Radio and Tags components, establishing key patterns:

1. **Token Structure Standardization**
   - Implemented consistent token hierarchy
   - Established pattern for state management in tokens
   - Created reusable patterns for layout and typography tokens

2. **Component-Specific Achievements**
   - Radio Component:
     - Implemented comprehensive token structure for states (default, hover, disabled, error)
     - Added support for sublabels with proper theming
     - Fixed vertical alignment issues using token-based spacing
     - Implemented transient props pattern for styled-components

   - Tags Component:
     - Established variant and color token patterns
     - Created extensible token structure for future variants

3. **Current Best Practices**
   - Using transient props ($) for styled-components to avoid DOM warnings
   - Implementing proper type safety with Readonly and mapped types
   - Maintaining consistent token structure across components

### Next Steps
1. Apply these patterns to remaining components
2. Document any component-specific token patterns
3. Review and update existing components for consistency

## Next Steps

1. **Component Development:**
   - Build higher-level components using primitive components
   - Ensure consistent usage of tokens across all components
   - Add comprehensive documentation for primitive components

2. **Token System:**
   - Continue refining token organization
   - Add semantic token mappings
   - Document token usage guidelines

3. **Documentation:**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation for primitive components
   - Add usage examples and best practices
   - Document token system architecture

## Active Decisions

1. **Primitive-First Architecture:**
   - All components should be built on top of primitive components
   - Primitives provide the foundation for consistent styling and behavior
   - Higher-level components compose primitives for specific use cases

2. **Token System Organization:**
   - Tokens are organized by category in dedicated files
   - Each token file has a specific responsibility
   - Tokens are the single source of truth for design values

3. **Component Structure:**
   - Primitives are kept simple and focused
   - Higher-level components handle specific use cases
   - Clear separation between primitive and composed components

4. **TypeScript Type System:**
   - Use type aliases instead of interfaces for all type definitions
   - Prevents accidental declaration merging
   - Provides better consistency across the codebase
   - Makes type definitions more predictable

## Active Development Focus

### Current Focus Areas
- Primitive component refinement
- Token system organization
- Higher-level component development
- TypeScript type system standardization

### Upcoming Tasks
- Continue building higher-level components
- Enhance token system with semantic mappings
- Develop comprehensive documentation
- Add accessibility improvements
- Create component showcase system
- Convert any remaining interfaces to types

### Active Decisions

#### Component Architecture
We've established a clear component hierarchy:

1. **Primitive Components:**
   - Block: Layout primitive
   - PrimitiveText: Typography primitive
   - PrimitiveButton: Button primitive

2. **Higher-Level Components:**
   - Built on top of primitives
   - Handle specific use cases
   - Maintain consistent styling through tokens

#### Token System
- Organized by category in dedicated files
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to maintain and extend
- Single source of truth for design values

#### TypeScript Standards
- Use type aliases for all type definitions
- Avoid interfaces to prevent declaration merging
- Keep type definitions simple and focused
- Use proper type inference where possible
- Document complex type relationships

#### Code Quality Standards
- All components must have comprehensive TypeScript types
- Primitives should be simple and focused
- Higher-level components should compose primitives
- Maintain consistent code style throughout
- Document design decisions and patterns
