# Progress

## What Works
- Modular component structure and rules are documented.
- Foundation tokens are defined and referenced in components.
- Button component serves as a reference implementation.
- Tags component has been refactored to follow the modular structure, including:
  - Proper TypeScript types and enums
  - Styled components
  - Token-based styling referencing foundation tokens
  - Utility functions for style computation
  - Separate Tag and SplitTag components
  - Consistent height handling across all tag variants
  - Custom border radius for different sizes of tags (squarical & rounded)
  - Support for different variants in left and right sections of SplitTags
  - Font integration with InterDisplay from the project fonts
  - Project setup and foundational architecture
  - Basic Tag component with different variants, statuses, sizes, and styles
  - SplitTag component with separate interactive sections
  - Consistent styling with foundation tokens
  - Pure slot-based API for leading and trailing content, with no deprecated icon-specific props
  - Support for complex custom content in slots including nested components and styled elements
- Demo system with comprehensive features:
  - Vertical navigation sidebar for component organization
  - Clean, modern UI with proper spacing and typography
  - Well-organized component showcases with descriptive labels
  - Visual distinction between different component variants and states
  - Proper demonstration of slot-based content customization with complex examples
  - Modular demo components organized in dedicated directories (`src/demos/`)
  - Decoupled component demos from main application for improved maintainability
  - Individual demo files for each component (ButtonDemo, TagsDemo)
  - Simplified main App component with clean component switching

## What's Left to Build
- Implement additional components using the established modular structure
- Expand token coverage for more design primitives
- Add comprehensive testing for components and utilities
- Create additional complex component demos (form elements, etc.)
- Implement interactive documentation with code snippets

## Current Status
- Documentation and rules are in place
- Two components (Button and Tags) follow the modular structure
- Demo system has been refactored for improved modularity and maintainability
- Tags component uses a pure slot-based API without deprecated icon props
- Code quality has been improved with cleaner structure and better TypeScript typing
- Component showcasing is well-organized with proper visual hierarchy

## Known Issues
- Some CSS styling may need fine-tuning for perfect alignment
- Token structure may need to evolve as new requirements emerge

## What's Left
- Continue building out component library with consistent patterns
- Implement remaining components with the established modular structure
- Further enhance the demo system with interactive examples
- Add keyboard navigation and accessibility improvements
- Apply slot-based patterns to other components where applicable
