- Implement interactive documentation with code snippets
- Apply DRY principles systematically across the codebase

## Current Status
- Documentation and rules are in place
- Ten components (Button, ButtonGroup, Tag, SplitTag, Breadcrumb, Avatar, AvatarGroup, Checkbox, Radio, and Switch) now follow the modular structure described in the system patterns document. The component library is growing with consistent patterns applied across all implementations.

- Avatar component demonstrates proper token structure and utility creation with slot-based API capability (though removed from demo for clarity)
- AvatarGroup component showcases component composition and reuse by building on Avatar component
- Tabs component demo moved to correct directory structure (src/demos/Tabs) for consistency
- DRY principles applied to components with reusable functions and utility extraction
- Consistent token structure maintained across components for readability
- Code quality has been improved with cleaner structure and better TypeScript typing
- Component showcasing is well-organized with proper visual hierarchy
- All components have been streamlined by removing unnecessary props like `testId` and `className`
- Self-documenting code preferred over verbose documentation comments
- Hooks have been enhanced with better TypeScript typing and flexibility
- useClickOutside hook refactored to support multiple refs for better component integration
- Unnecessary optimizations like premature memoization have been avoided for simplicity

## Known Issues
- Some CSS styling may need fine-tuning for perfect alignment
- Token structure may need to evolve as new requirements emerge
- Breadcrumb component needs additional keyboard navigation support
- ButtonGroup component needs additional keyboard navigation support
- Need to apply DRY principles more systematically across all components
- Button hover/focus states need refinement
- Additional keyboard navigation support for ButtonGroup and AvatarGroup components
- Need to implement proper focus management for AvatarGroup selection

## What's Left
- Continue building out component library with consistent patterns
- Implement remaining components with the established modular structure
- Further enhance the demo system with interactive examples
- Add keyboard navigation and accessibility improvements
- Apply slot-based patterns to other components where applicable
- Continue refining the codebase with DRY principles
