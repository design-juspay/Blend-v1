# Progress

## Project Progress Tracker

### What Works

#### Component Structure
- ✅ Modular directory structure for components
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types for all components
- ✅ Styled components with proper theme integration
- ✅ Component token system with foundation tokens
- ✅ Utility functions for component styling
- ✅ Component demos with examples
- ✅ Component reusability patterns (SplitTag reusing Tag functionality)

#### Specific Components
- ✅ Button component with variants, sizes, and states
- ✅ Tag component with variants, statuses, sizes, and shapes
  - ✅ Refactored to use slot-based API for flexible content
  - ✅ Completed removal of deprecated icon-specific props
  - ✅ Completed removal of `style` prop in favor of `shape` prop
  - ✅ Fixed styling inconsistencies across variants
- ✅ SplitTag component as a standalone component
  - ✅ Implemented with primaryTag and secondaryTag API
  - ✅ Added fallback to regular Tag when secondaryTag is not provided
  - ✅ Reused Tag tokens and utilities for consistency
  - ✅ Created dedicated demo with comprehensive examples

#### Demo System
- ✅ Basic demo layout
- ✅ Component showcase sections
- ✅ Example variety covering component features
- ✅ Dedicated demo pages for each component (Button, Tag, SplitTag)
- ✅ Navigation sidebar for component selection

### In Progress

- ❌ Documentation site

## Known Issues

### Component Issues
- Tag component needs accessibility improvements (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
- Button focus states need refinement for better accessibility
- Need to establish consistent pattern for component refs
- SplitTag component needs accessibility improvements for keyboard navigation between sections

### System Issues
- Token system needs more consistent naming
- Need to establish pattern for responsive props
- Need to clarify component composition patterns

## Next Steps

1. Complete Form input components
2. Add accessibility improvements to existing components
3. Refine token system for better consistency
4. Add more comprehensive demo examples
5. Begin development of layout components

## What's Left to Build
- Implement additional components using the established modular structure
- Expand token coverage for more design primitives
- Add comprehensive testing for components and utilities
- Create additional complex component demos (form elements, etc.)
- Implement interactive documentation with code snippets

## Current Status
- Documentation and rules are in place
- Three components (Button, Tag, and SplitTag) follow the modular structure
- Demo system has been refactored for improved modularity and maintainability
- Tags component uses a pure slot-based API without deprecated icon props
- SplitTag component demonstrates proper component reuse and extension patterns
- Code quality has been improved with cleaner structure and better TypeScript typing
- Component showcasing is well-organized with proper visual hierarchy

## Known Issues
- Some CSS styling may need fine-tuning for perfect alignment
- Token structure may need to evolve as new requirements emerge

## What's Left
- Continue building out component library with consistent patterns
- Implement remaining components with the established modular structure
- Further enhance the demo system with interactive examples
- Add keyboard navigation and accessibility improvements
- Apply slot-based patterns to other components where applicable
