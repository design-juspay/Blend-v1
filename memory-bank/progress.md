## Project Progress Tracker

### What Works

#### Component Structure
- ✅ Modular directory structure for components
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types for all components
- ✅ Styled components with proper theme integration
- ✅ Component token system with foundation tokens
- ✅ Utility functions for component styling
- ✅ Component demos with examples
- ✅ Component reusability patterns (SplitTag reusing Tag functionality)
- ✅ Style encapsulation (no className props to maintain design system integrity)
- ✅ Consistent use of type aliases over interfaces for better TypeScript patterns
- ✅ DRY code principles application in component implementation

#### Specific Components
- ✅ Button component with variants, sizes, and states
- ✅ ButtonGroup component for combining related buttons
  - ✅ Support for different button group sizes (small, medium, large)
  - ✅ Stacked and non-stacked layout options
  - ✅ Three modes for button type handling (singlePrimary, allSecondary, noTransform)
  - ✅ Proper styling for connected buttons with correct border radius
  - ✅ Utility functions for button position and type transformation
  - ✅ Comprehensive demo with examples of all variants and modes
- ✅ Tag component with variants, statuses, sizes, and shapes
  - ✅ Refactored to use slot-based API for flexible content
  - ✅ Completed removal of deprecated icon-specific props
  - ✅ Completed removal of `style` prop in favor of `shape` prop
  - ✅ Fixed styling inconsistencies across variants
- ✅ SplitTag component as a standalone component
  - ✅ Implemented with primaryTag and secondaryTag API
  - ✅ Added fallback to regular Tag when secondaryTag is not provided
  - ✅ Reused Tag tokens and utilities for consistency
  - ✅ Created dedicated demo with comprehensive examples
- ✅ Breadcrumb component with default and truncated variants
  - ✅ Implemented with clean slot-based API
  - ✅ Added support for custom content on both sides of items
  - ✅ Included proper accessibility attributes for navigation
  - ✅ Created dedicated demo with comprehensive examples
  - ✅ Applied DRY principles with reusable rendering functions
  - ✅ Used self-documenting code over verbose comments
  - ✅ Maintained consistent token structure for better readability

#### Demo System
- ✅ Basic demo layout
- ✅ Component showcase sections
- ✅ Example variety covering component features
- ✅ Dedicated demo pages for each component (Button, ButtonGroup, Tag, SplitTag, Breadcrumb, Tabs)
- ✅ Navigation sidebar for component selection
- ✅ Beautified demos with consistent headers and explanatory text
- ✅ Improved visual hierarchy with section dividers and better spacing
- ✅ Consistent directory structure with all demos in src/demos/{ComponentName} folders

#### Code Quality
- ✅ Applied DRY principles to reduce code repetition
- ✅ Created shared type definitions for better type safety
- ✅ Implemented reusable helper functions to avoid duplication
- ✅ Used type aliases over interfaces for clearer intent
- ✅ Enhanced component rendering with reusable functions
- ✅ Maintained consistent token structure across components
- ✅ Improved hook reusability with flexible TypeScript typing
- ✅ Avoided over-optimization (removed unnecessary memoization)

#### Hooks and Utilities
- ✅ Enhanced useClickOutside hook to accept single ref or array of refs
- ✅ Improved TypeScript typing for hooks to support various element types
- ✅ Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation to hooks
- ✅ Implemented proper cleanup in hooks with event listeners
- ✅ Created consistent API patterns for all hooks
- ✅ Centralized hook exports through index files

## Known Issues

### Component Issues
- Tag component needs accessibility improvements (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
- Button focus states need refinement for better accessibility
- Need to establish consistent pattern for component refs
- SplitTag component needs accessibility improvements for keyboard navigation between sections
- Breadcrumb component needs keyboard navigation improvements
- ButtonGroup component needs additional keyboard navigation support

### System Issues
- Token system needs more consistent naming
- Need to establish pattern for responsive props
- Need to clarify component composition patterns

## Next Steps

1. Complete Form input components
2. Add accessibility improvements to existing components
3. Refine token system for better consistency
4. Add more comprehensive demo examples
5. Begin development of layout components
6. Continue applying DRY principles across components

## What's Left to Build
- Implement additional components using the established modular structure
- Expand token coverage for more design primitives
- Add comprehensive testing for components and utilities
- Create additional complex component demos (form elements, etc.)
- Implement interactive documentation with code snippets
- Apply DRY principles systematically across the codebase

## Current Status
- Documentation and rules are in place
- Five components (Button, ButtonGroup, Tag, SplitTag, and Breadcrumb) follow the modular structure
- Demo system has been enhanced with beautified demos and better organization
- All components use a pure slot-based API without deprecated icon props
- SplitTag component demonstrates proper component reuse and extension patterns
- Breadcrumb component showcases semantic markup and accessibility patterns
- ButtonGroup component demonstrates utility function extraction and DRY principles
- Tabs component demo moved to correct directory structure (src/demos/Tabs) for consistency
- DRY principles applied to components with reusable functions and utility extraction
- Consistent token structure maintained across components for readability
- Code quality has been improved with cleaner structure and better TypeScript typing
- Component showcasing is well-organized with proper visual hierarchy
- All components have been streamlined by removing unnecessary props like `testId` and `className`
- Self-documenting code preferred over verbose documentation comments
- Hooks have been enhanced with better TypeScript typing and flexibility
- useClickOutside hook refactored to support multiple refs for better component integration
- Unnecessary optimizations like premature memoization have been avoided for simplicity

## Known Issues
- Some CSS styling may need fine-tuning for perfect alignment
- Token structure may need to evolve as new requirements emerge
- Breadcrumb component needs additional keyboard navigation support
- ButtonGroup component needs additional keyboard navigation support
- Need to apply DRY principles more systematically across all components

## What's Left
- Continue building out component library with consistent patterns
- Implement remaining components with the established modular structure
- Further enhance the demo system with interactive examples
- Add keyboard navigation and accessibility improvements
- Apply slot-based patterns to other components where applicable
- Continue refining the codebase with DRY principles
