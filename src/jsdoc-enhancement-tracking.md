## 📝 Standardized JSDoc Template

```tsx
/**
 * @description [Component description with key features]
 * @feature [Feature 1]
 * @feature [Feature 2]
 * @feature [Feature 3]
 * @example Basic Usage
 * ```tsx
 * import { ComponentName, RequiredEnum } from "blend-v1";
 * 
 * <ComponentName
 *   requiredProp="value"
 *   basicProp={RequiredEnum.VALUE}
 * />
 * ```
 * @example Intermediate Usage
 * ```tsx
 * import { ComponentName, RequiredEnum, OptionalType } from "blend-v1";
 * 
 * <ComponentName
 *   requiredProp="value"
 *   variant={RequiredEnum.VARIANT}
 *   optionalProp="additional content"
 *   onEvent={() => console.log('Event triggered')}
 * />
 * ```
 * @example Advanced Usage with All Props
 * ```tsx
 * import { 
 *   ComponentName, 
 *   RequiredEnum1, 
 *   RequiredEnum2,
 *   RequiredType1,
 *   RequiredType2 
 * } from "blend-v1";
 * 
 * const sampleData = [
 *   { id: 1, label: "Sample 1", value: 100 },
 *   { id: 2, label: "Sample 2", value: 200 }
 * ];
 * 
 * <ComponentName
 *   // All props demonstrated here
 *   requiredProp="value"

## 🔍 Import Verification Rules
- All imports must be verified against `lib/main.ts` exports
- Components must import from `"blend-v1"` not relative paths
- Include all necessary types and enums used in examples
- Verify that sample data structures match expected prop types

## 📦 Sample Data Standards
- Use realistic, meaningful data (not "foo", "bar", "baz")
- Include diverse examples (success, error, loading states)
- Use consistent naming conventions across examples
- Provide inline sample data when needed for complex props

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. ✅ Create this tracking document
2. ✅ Establish standardized JSDoc template pattern
3. ✅ Enhanced 5 key components with comprehensive examples
4. ✅ Verified import statements for completed components
5. ⏳ Continue with remaining 28 components
6. ⏳ Fix minor linting issues in TextInput
7. ⏳ Complete all Priority 1 components
8. ⏳ Enhance Priority 2 and 3 components

## 📋 Key Patterns Established
- ✅ **Import Standards**: All examples use `import { Component, Types } from "blend-v1"`
- ✅ **Example Structure**: Basic → Intermediate → Advanced usage patterns
- ✅ **Realistic Data**: Sample data uses meaningful, real-world examples
- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Examples demonstrate ALL available props
- ✅ **Multiple Scenarios**: Different states, sizes, variants shown

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes
- **Verified Exports**: All imports verified against `lib/main.ts`
- **Type Safety**: All examples include proper TypeScript types
- **Best Practices**: React hooks, state management, and event handling
- **Icon Integration**: Consistent use of lucide-react icons
- **Accessibility**: Examples include ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
